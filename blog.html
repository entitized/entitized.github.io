Uni Stuff
════════

tags: uni, personal

So I've been in uni for a few years now and I basically just
didn't do shit. I mean I tried but I was in a very bad headspace
in these last couple of years. All the shit going on in the world
mixed with my personal issues affected me more than I ever thought 
it would and getting out of that hole was and is a strenious journey.
Now I'm seeing people that started uni around the same time as me 
already getting a degree and I honestly just feel like a failiure.
I'm nowhere near that level, it's actually kinda laughable 
where I'm at right now. 

Now I  g u e s s  I need to cut myself some slack, because actually
getting out of that headspace and picking up the pieces felt and 
feels like a goddamn herculean task.

And now that I started learning shit, it's actually 
fucking fun, and easier than I thought it would be. 
Well I guess that's just how fucking life is.

Anyway have a good one.

So I want to add a monthly collection of links with a short summary 
what it's about or why I think it's cool. Partly to share cool stuff
on the internet, partly to not forget about all the cool stuff that's 
on there. 


My New Blog

Hello,
this is a really stupid solution for making a blog,
but fuck it, it's simple, it's nice, and who'll read this anyways?

This page is literally just a &lt;link href=&gt; to my stylesheet, 
a backlink, some &lt;meta&gt; tags and a &lt;pre&gt; tag.

Anyways, have fun reading this shit. :)
